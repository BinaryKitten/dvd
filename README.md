Dvd/Movie Library
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, DVD/Movie Library application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is designed to be used as a way of tracking Movies I own so that I can view them whilst out in stores/shops etc.

I hope to continually improve this source so that it can be used as a way of learning for both myself and others.
